### NP-Completeness Teory
- NP-Completeness provides negative results: some problems cannot be solved efficiently
- A given problem X cannot be solved in polynomial time
### Some Hard Problems
#### Hamiltonian Cycle Problem
$O(n!m) = 2^{O(nlg(n))}$
#### Maximum Independent Set Problem
An independent set of G = (V, E) is a subset I ⊆ V suchthat no two vertices in I are adjacent in G.
#### Formula Satisfiability（公式的可满足性问题）
Input: boolean formula with n variables, with ∨, ∧, ¬ operators.
Output: whether the boolean formula is satisfiable
